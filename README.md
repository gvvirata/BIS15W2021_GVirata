# BIS15W2021_GVirata

Hello! This is my repository for BIS 015L Winter 2021, which includes all of my .rmd files and data for this course.

## About Me

I am a second-year NPB major originally from San Diego. My hobbies include: walking/hiking/biking, exploring new places and trying new foods! I am excited to be part of this class and hope to learn more on how to use R programming to manage and analyze data.
